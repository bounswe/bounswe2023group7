## Progress Summary

During the milestone week, we successfully concluded the development of key features such as user profiles, reviews, forums, and rating functionalities. A customer presentation was delivered, and we compiled a comprehensive milestone report. Additionally, we introduced several search features and initiated the implementation of the entity feature, including the corresponding API endpoints.

Looking ahead to the next week, our focus will be on finalizing the entity feature and addressing bugs in both the mobile and frontend aspects. Simultaneously, we plan to kick off the implementation of recommendations and group features in both the backend and frontend. Another significant task on our agenda is the the second phase of annotation research.

## Planned vs. Actual
 Since in the last lab report, we planned for the just one week, there are lots of issues we had done. 
 
 Also, there are some features are left in incomplete such as entity page and edit/delete of review, thread and comments. We completed them after milestone delivering.

## Risks

There is no big risks to complete the above tasks. The only risk in general that the annotations can require more efforts than we think. 

## Requirements Ranking
**1. Annotations**

        1.2.4. Annotations
        1.2.4.1. System shall allow users to annotate content on the platform with text or images.
        1.2.4.2. Annotations can be a URI that should act as a hyperlink, or semantic resources that provide detailed information about the resource.
        1.2.4.3. Annotations shall be compliant with the W3C Web Annotation Data Model and checked to follow W3C standards.

***Justification:***  Annotations are crucial as they are consistently requested and are essential for all groups regardless of their project topic. They're requested yearly in this course as well. Also, since it is a new context for almost all of our team members, it may be challenging as well. As a summary, the customer specifically highlighted annotations, making their completion a priority for our project's success.

**2. Entities**

        1.1.3.19. Entity Page
        1.1.3.19.1. Users shall be able to create a page for game entities.
        1.1.3.19.2 Users and guests shall be able to view game entities.
        1.1.3.19.3. Game entities are characters, packages, items, and environments.
        1.1.3.19.4. Users shall be able to reach the entity pages from game pages.

***Justification:*** : Entities, covering characters, items, packages, and environments, are important due to positive feedback and customer emphasis. Their features was asked specifically in Milestone 2 with an example. Therefore, it really contributes to the project's overall completeness. As a summary, completion of the entity section is crucial based on Milestone 2 expectations for delivering a comprehensive solution.

**3. Recommendations**

        1.2.5.Recommendations
        1.2.5.1. System shall recommend the posts according to the user's preferences.
        1.2.5.2. System shall recommend other users according to the user's preferences.
        1.2.5.3. System shall recommend games for users.

***Justification:*** Recommendations for games are vital, as they enhance user experience by suggesting games for each specific title and in the general games page.
They are also highlighted in Milestone 2 and it's necessary to finalize for a more user-friendly platform experience. After the milestone, it is suggested to us to focus more on the recommendations by the customer.

**4. Group**

        1.1.6. Group
        1.1.6.1. Users shall be able to create a group.
        1.1.6.2. Group administrators shall be able to add a title for the group.
        1.1.6.3. Group administrators shall be able to specify the number of members of the group.
        1.1.6.4. Group administrators shall be able to add description to their groups.
        1.1.6.5. Group administrators shall be able to specify the game on their groups.
        1.1.6.6. Group administrators shall be able to discard a group member.
        1.1.6.7. Users shall be able to display the members of the group.
        1.1.6.8. Users shall be able to filter the groups according to games, tags, and names.
        1.1.6.9. Users shall be able to sort the groups alphabetically, by number of users, number of empty slots ascending or descending.
        1.1.6.10. Users shall be able to participate in the group unless it is full.
        1.1.6.11. Users shall be able to leave the group.

***Justification:*** It is asked by the customers in the requirements at the beginning of the projects in CMPE352. However, the customer specifially emphasized recommendations, annotations, entities instead of groups. We will implement groups but with a lower priority than the mentioned features.

**5. Search**

        1.2.2. Search
        1.2.2.1. System shall allow users to search for forum thread, subforum, forum comment, upcoming titles, gaming communities-groups, users, and games.
        1.2.2.2. System shall allow the user to filter the search for the users, games, and tags.
        1.2.2.3. System shall allow users to use sorting features ascending or descending.
        1.2.2.4. System shall allow users to sort the threads, alphabetically, by first post date, by last post date,by number of comments in threads.
        1.2.2.5. System shall allow users to sort the comments by date, number of replies and difference of upvotes and downvotes for the comment.
        1.2.2.6. System shall allow users to sort upcoming titles by post date or launch date.

***Justification:*** Backend implementation and some of implementation in the frontend and mobile for search is done, but semantic search remains pending. It holds significance but is not an immediate priority since it was not emphasized or asked by the customer specifically. As a summary, backend,frontend, and mobile work is almost complete for a normal search; however, further improvements, such as semantic search, will add value if time allows.

**6. Notifications**

        1.2.3. Notifications
        1.2.3.1. System shall notify the user when another user likes or comments on the user's post.
        1.2.3.2. System shall notify the user when another user likes or comments the user's comment.
        1.2.3.3. System shall notify the user when another user follows the user.
        1.2.3.4. System shall send notifications to the user about other users' posts for which the user has previously turned on notifications.
        1.2.3.5. System shall send notification to user for update in game profile which user has followed.

***Justification:***  Notifications, while beneficial, are not as critical as entities or recommendations. If time permits, implementation will be done as they enhance user engagement.

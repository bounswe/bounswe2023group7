## Progress Summary
This week we did dockerization of backend, database and frontend, deployed our project to AWS, created GitHub Actions Pipeline, implemented our login and signup endpoints, created user table on the database, revised our use-case diagrams, completed missing sequence diagrams and scenerios, created our backend, frontend and mobile folders, designed home page and page structure, and created RAM for the project.

Our main goal for the next week is the implementation of pages, which we plan to present for Tuesday for both frontend and mobile, and developing some of missing key endpoints. Also previous deliverables substantially ready to first milestone.

## Planned vs. Actual
We have planned to exclude event from our project for previous week but we couldn't do it. We checked if it effects the other parts of the project and made analysis. This week we will be removing "event".

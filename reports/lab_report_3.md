## Progress Summary
This week we prepared our project plan for the semester, decided on the technologies for backend, frontend and mobile and started learning them. We decided on our communication plan for subteams. 

Our main goal for the next week is the design of pages, successfully deploying the project and creating the environment for development in backend, frontend and mobile. And also making previous deliverables ready to first milestone.

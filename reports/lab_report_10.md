## Planned vs. Actual
We planned to complete the backend part of the annotation feature but it could not be completed.
Due to backend service is crashed because of mobile, our progress is interrupted. We could not finalize lots of issues. Upcoming titles are still to be implemented in backend so frontend and mobile wait for the endpoints.

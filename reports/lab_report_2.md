**Team Name:** Group 7

## Progress Summary
We have integrated the newcomers to our teams. We briefly introduced what we did last semester. Then we revised requirements to adapt with changes made by customer. It was a bit challenging since we tried to keep changes minimal. 
Also we made a survey to get information about teammates' preferences and we got divided into sub-teams.

For the upcoming week, we are planning to revise the other project deliverables such as use-case diagram, mock-up, use scenarios. Also, we are going to do project plan for the whole semester considering the milestone 1, milestone 2 and project delivery deadline.

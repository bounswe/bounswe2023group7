**Team Name:** Group 7  
**Date:** 10.10.2023  

## Progress Summary
We have integrated the newcomers to our teams. We briefly introduced what we did last semester. Then we revised requirements to adapt with changes made by customer. It was a bit challanging since we tried to keep changes minimal. 
Also we made a survey to get information about teammates' preferences and we got divided into sub-teams.

Provide a high-level overview of **your progress during the week.** Mention any significant achievements, challenges, changes in the project plan, and write **the main objective for the following week** (not more than five sentences; you should be able to tell it to someone in 30 seconds in an elevator).

## What was planned for the week? How did it go?
List the tasks that you planned to complete during the week. These should be based on the project plan and progress reports of previous weeks. If they are complete, include a reference to the related project development artifact.

## Completed tasks that were not planned for the week
List the tasks that you did not anticipate in the project plan or in the previous week's report but completed anyway.

## Planned vs. Actual
Describe any discrepancies between the project plan and the actual progress. Did tasks take as much time as expected, or shorter/longer? Did you accomplish all the tasks planned for the week? Describe any new issues that you encountered during the week, which were not planned for. These could be technical or non-technical issues. Explain how you plan to address these issues in the upcoming week(s).

## Your plans for the next week
List the specific tasks or actions you plan to take in the upcoming week. These should be based on the project plan and the issues discussed earlier. All action items should be linked to the relevant issues.

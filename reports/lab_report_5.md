## Progress Summary

Over the past two weeks, our efforts have been dedicated to both feature development and milestone preparation. We've successfully implemented several crucial endpoints, including createGame, getGame, followGame, unfollowGame, and forgotPassword. On the web platform, our focus was on feature development, resulting in the completion of login, sign-up, home, game, creating game, sidebar, header, and forum pages. Meanwhile, on the mobile platform, we've accomplished login, sign-up, the home page, and integrated a loading spinner. While a forgot password page has been created for both platforms, it's yet to be connected to the backend.

During the second week, our primary focus shifted towards milestone reporting. We compiled a comprehensive customer presentation, showcasing our progress thus far. Additionally, we tagged a pre-release version, reviewed all deliverables, crafted a detailed report outlining both our collective and individual contributions, and culminated our efforts by submitting the milestone report.

Moving forward, our primary focus will be to strategize for the second customer milestone. We aim to carefully consider the feedback received from the first milestone, using it as a guiding framework for the upcoming phase. Throughout the following week, our objectives include the creation of search, filter, and review-related endpoints. We'll prioritize completing the connections of existing endpoints to both the frontend and the mobile platforms. Additionally, our aim is to refine and finalize the overall functionality of the game page.

## Planned vs. Actual

In the previous lab report, we restricted our planning to just a week, resulting in numerous unforeseen issues. Furthermore, we accommodated some additional implementations for the customer meeting, which were not part of the initial plan.

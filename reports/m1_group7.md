# **1. Executive Summary**<a name="executive-summary" />

##  **1.1. Project Description**<a name="project-description" />

Welcome to our project, a gaming community platform designed for gamers,
e-sport players and developers to connect and cooperate. The objective
of the project is to create an area where players can discuss different
games, read reviews and participate in online events.

We have a forum on our platform that allows users to engage in
discussions and share their views on different topics related to games.
The platform can be used by developers as an advertising tool for their
forthcoming titles, which will also be accessible to all users. Our
group finding feature allows users to find friends and form teams to
play with, making it easier to connect with likeminded players.

Furthermore, the platform allows for the creation and promotion of
online events for gamers, making it easier for them to participate in
different events without having to be physically present.
Recommendations for new games and communities that are in line with
their interests are provided by our recommendation system. User profiles
provide a medium for gamers to showcase their gaming interests.

The platform will be available in both web and application form, making
it possible to use the platform from anywhere at any time. Finally, the
purpose of our community platform is to give gamers, developers and
eSports players access to one another. We hope that users will find the
platform informative, user-friendly, and helpful in enhancing their
overall experience.

##  **1.2. Status of Project**<a name="status-of-project" />

At the beginning of this semester, we welcomed our new team members, creating a sense of unity and integration in our team. We took an extensive approach to project development by reviewing last yearâ€™s requirements and class diagrams, to ensure our foundation was solid. As part of our creative process, we considered specific game-related features that could enhance the capabilities of our system. 

We also designed a poll to learn team member's capabilities and experiences in related areas, and we organized our team into three subteams: backend, frontend, and mobile. This division allowed us to narrow down our responsibilites, ideas, and expertise to the specific needs of each field. For each sub-team, we carefully selected the most appropriate technology to ensure the success of our project. In mobile we chose Flutter because of its ease of learning, and modern interfaces. For frontend we chose ReactJS because of team members already have little experienc with it and documentations are easy to find in web. Backend team chose to use NodeJs with TypeScript and NestJs because of performance, type safety, and structured development concerns. Committed to continuous learning, we began to acquire the necessary skills and knowledge in these chosen field of technologies. 


On this trip, we named our project â€˜Ludosâ€™, the Latin word for â€˜Gameâ€™, which encapsulates the essence of our efforts.

We set up projects dedicated to frontend, backend, mobile and database development. Significant improvements were made to critical functions such as login, registration, logout, game pages and forum page between mobile and frontend platforms and backend services were carefully designed to support these key functions. This comprehensive approach has put us on the path to realizing the full potential of our exciting project â€˜Ludosâ€™.

To simplify our project management, we made full use of GitHub Projects' planning features, choosing tools that would best facilitate our development. Dockerizing our project improved our development efficiency and stability by automating deployment through GitHub Actions and pipelining practices.

## **1.3. Forward Plan**<a name="forward-plan" />

We will write endpoints for the profile page and design and implement the page for both mobile and web. The profile page will allow users to view and edit their profile information, such as their name, bio, favorite games and friends information. It will also allow users to view their activity on the platform, such as their posts, comments, and likes.

We will implement game and forum endpoints and create and design pages for these endpoints on mobile and web. The game endpoints will allow users to explore new games on the platform, and the forum endpoints will allow users to discuss games and other topics on the platform. We will also implement search functionality and design the UI/UX for the search page. The search page will allow users to search for content on the platform, such as posts, users, and games.

We will write group endpoints and design and implement the group page for mobile and backend. The group page will allow users to create and join groups, and to view and interact with other members of the group.

We will write entity endpoints and design and implement the entity page for mobile and web. The entity page will allow users to view and interact with entities, such as characters, packages, items, and environments. We will also write functionality for recommendation for content to users. This functionality will recommend content and games to users based on their interests and activity on the platform.

We will write notifications features for both web and mobile. These features will allow users to receive notifications about activity on the platform, such as new comments on their posts and new messages from other users.

We have two more milestones, and we will be prepared for them also. We will continue to develop the features listed above.




# **2. Customer Feedback and Reflections**<a name="customer-feedback-and-reflections" />
At the outset of our game community platform project, we embarked on a journey marked by valuable customer feedback and insightful reflections. During our milestone demo, we engaged with our audience and client, who provided us with crucial insights that have shaped the direction of our platform's development. Also, we got feedback regularly by laboratory work and meetings with our customer.

During our milestone demo, we gathered essential feedback and reflections from our audience and client. The first area of concern was our Home page. Our audience was not impressed with the initial content, which primarily consisted of mock data mostly related to issues and problems. They suggested that the first user experience should be more game-related and engaging. They recommended showcasing trending games, recommended titles, and visually appealing, categorized posts related to games. The goal was to create a more captivating and relevant experience for users right from the start.

Another issue surfaced during our mobile presentation. It was noted that the 'i' key on the keyboard malfunctioned during the login process, causing delays and requiring us to be extra cautious about maintaining audience engagement to prevent disconnection.

In response to early feedback at the project's outset, we were told about the importance of making our project more game-specific. Our customer encouraged us to focus on game-related features rather than generic content. In light of this, we introduced the concept of entities and engaged in discussions about how to integrate more game-related features. These discussions resulted in the incorporation of new features to align our project more closely with the gaming community's interests such as entities (packages, characters, items, environments) and game specific features (system requirements, platforms, etc.).

Additionally, feedback from our weekly lab activities emphasized the need to share links to the issues we opened, as well as artifacts and pull requests. It was also suggested that tasks should be assigned to individuals rather than the entire team, promoting a more efficient workflow.

In summary, the feedback and reflections we received have played a crucial role in shaping our platform. We have made adjustments to create a more engaging and game-specific user experience, while also improving our workflow and communication based on valuable input from our audience and client.

# **4. Evaluation of the Status of Deliverables**<a name="evaluation-of-the-status-of-deliverables" />

## **4.1. Software Requirements Specification**<a name="software-requirements-specification" />

After the previous period, we held a customer meeting again at the beginning of this year. Some differences emerged at this meeting. We have updated our project requirements in line with the differences requested by our customer and we have held meetings and prepared certain plans on how we can realise these targets.

## **4.2. Software Design (UML diagrams)**<a name="software-design" />

As mentioned in 4.1, our project requirements changed with the client meeting held at the beginning of this period. Therefore, we had to update our UML diagrams and re-present them to our customer in the way they wanted us to. We also updated and re-presented these diagrams within our plans. Each diagram was produced using the features of the Lucidchart software. Although these diagrams have already been designed, we will keep them current by incorporating any changes that may emerge throughout the project\'s development.

## **4.3. Mockups and Scenarios**<a name="mockups-and-scenarios" />

As mentioned in 4.1, our project requirements changed with the client meeting held at the beginning of this period. Therefore, apart from our UML diagrams, we also had to update our Mockups and Scenarios. Within the changes and innovations requested by our customer, we made the necessary changes and additions to these sections. We have developed distinct scenarios to showcase the key features of our website such as Forums, Groups, and Game Pages, Users. For each scenario, we have included information on the user persona, their story, goals, and actions. Additionally, we have incorporated user requirements into the acceptance criteria section. To provide visual context, we have included mock-ups of the pages where these scenarios take place. We believe that these scenarios will highlight the unique aspects of our website and demonstrate its value to potential users.

## **4.4. Project Plan**<a name="project-plan" />

Since we started to offer a product to our customers, we had to prepare a brand new project plan this period. What will be achieved at which milestone was planned one by one and these tasks were delegated to the relevant teammates. With this plan covering the entire project, we believe that our team will be able to successfully deliver the product to our customer within the planned dates.

## **4.5. Communication Plan**<a name="communication-plan" />

When our groups were initially formed, we established a WhatsApp group for communication. We deliberated on which communication channel to use,
and ultimately agreed on Discord due to its user-friendly audio and video communication features, widespread usage among group members, and
convenient mobile application. We set up ten Discord channels, with General, Resources, Meeting Notes, and Templates being the most
frequently used. Lounge audio channel was utilized for our meetings, which we aimed to conduct face-to-face on Thursdays or Fridays. In instances where we required urgent communication, WhatsApp was used as it allowed for immediate messaging.

This year, we have also divided into three sub-teams as backend, frontend and mobile. These groups communicate among themselves through the mentioned channels. For the tasks related to the sub-teams, the relevant people can easily communicate through these channels.

Surveys feature on WhatsApp was also employed for decision-making purposes since Discord lacks this function. Tasks were created, discussed, and reviewed on Github.

Communication with the lecturer and teaching assistants was facilitated through lectures in class, PSs on every monday, and Discord via communicator.

## **4.6. Responsibility Assignment Matrix**<a name="responsibility-assignment-matrix" />

When we began preparing this report, we initiated the creation of the Project Plan and RAM. We utilized meeting notes and the issues and pull requests list to input the completed work. We completed the RAM table by consulting the meeting notes and the issues, pull requests list. Each team member reviewed their own work and filled in any missing information.

## **4.7. Milestone Review**<a name="milestone-review" />

As we are about to finish the first phase of our project plans, we held a meeting again. We talked about what we have achieved in the first milestone in our renewed plan and how we can be more successful. In this milestone, we successfully completed most of the requirements that our customer asked from us.

## **4.8. A Pre-release Version of Our Project**<a name="prerelease-version-of-project" />

When we finished the first milestone, we had to present the requirements that our customer wanted from us. So we deployed the part of our project for this milestone and made it available. We showed the necessary features to our customer and received feedbacks. These feedbacks will be very useful for us in which direction we should evolve in future milestones.

## **4.9. Individual Contributions**<a name="individual-contributions" />

In the project, everyone filled an individual contribution report by examining the issues and pull requests made by themselves. In this report, both the work done and the work reviewed were included. In this way, it became clear in which area everyone took part and provided us with information for us to make more effective assignments in the project.


# **5. Evaluation of Tools and Processes**<a name="evaluation-of-tools-and-processes" />

## **5.1. Evaluation of Tools**<a name="evaluation-of-tools" />

We have used various tools to accomplish different goals up to this
milestone. When choosing a tool for a specific task, we considered
multiple factors. It was important that the tool allowed us to work
together collaboratively and monitor each other\'s progress, as we
assigned tasks among team members to ensure everyone contributed
equally. Additionally, we prioritized tools that were easy to use and
tools that had more free useful features. List and evaluation of the
tools that we used can be found below.


###  **5.1.1. Discord**<a name="discord" />

Our team has been using Discord for communication during the development
of our application. Discord has been the primary communication platform
for our team, allowing us to collaborate and communicate in real-time
during the development process. Additionally, we used discord to
communicate with our teacher and assistant.

Discord has met our communication needs by providing a variety of
communication options, including text, voice, and video chat. This has
allowed us to have real-time discussions about the project, share ideas,
ask questions, and provide feedback to each other. The accessibility of
Discord on multiple devices and operating systems has also been
convenient for team members to stay connected and communicate regardless
of their location.

###  **5.1.2. Whatsapp**<a name="whatsapp" />

In addition to using Discord as our primary communication tool, our team
has also utilized WhatsApp to communicate so far. WhatsApp has primarily
been used for quick updates and informal communication between team
members.

The most important benefit that encouraged us to use Whatsapp was its
convenience. The app is easily accessible on mobile devices, making it
easy for team members to communicate on-the-go or outside of scheduled
meetings. This has allowed for quick updates and informal communication
to take place without disrupting the flow of work.

###  **5.1.3. Lucidchart**<a name="lucidchart" />

Our team has used Lucidchart as a tool for creating use case, sequence,
and class diagrams for the application. Lucidchart is a web-based
diagramming and visualization tool that allows for collaborative
diagramming in real-time. Its ease of use (especially drag and drop
interface and pre-built templates) and collaborative capabilities encouraged us to use it. We
have worked on the same page together to create use-case and class
diagrams.

###  **5.1.4. ProjectLibre**<a name="projectlibre" />

Our team used ProjectLibre, an open-source project management software,
for creating our project plan for the development of the application.
ProjectLibre offers a range of features for project scheduling, resource
allocation, and tracking progress.

ProjectLibre allowed us to easily create our project plan as a Gantt
Chart by inputting our project tasks, their durations and assignees.

###  **5.1.5. Figma**<a name="figma" />

Our team used Figma for all the designs of the mockups. We created out
web and android samples in Figma. Figma is a web-based interface design
tool that allows users to create, collaborate, and share design mockups
and prototypes. It is popular among UX/UI designers and design teams for
its real-time collaboration features, cloud-based storage, and
accessibility across different platforms. Figma provides a range of
design tools, including vector editing, prototyping, and design system
creation. It also allows for version control and commenting on designs,
making it easier for teams to work together and iterate on designs

Figma allowed us to create higher class mockup design and work together
effectively.
###  **5.1.6. Tools for Mobile Team**<a name="mobile" />
We utilize Flutter, Dart, Android Studio, and Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as essential components in our toolkit. Here's an evaluation of our tools, emphasizing our unique experiences and considerations:
#### **5.1.6.1. Flutter & Dart**<a name="Flutter&Dart" />
As we started using Flutter and Dart for our project, we didn't have much experience with these technologies at first. However, the widespread popularity of Flutter in the developer community made it easy for us to overcome this lack of experience. There were plenty of online resources and a lively community, which meant we could quickly find answers to our questions without having to go through long documents or watch extensive video tutorials. This not only made our learning process smoother but also boosted our excitement about mastering this language.

A game-changer for our team was Flutter's hot reload function. This feature allowed us to make instant changes and see their impact on our app in real-time. It significantly sped up our learning process and made it easy for us to try out different styles and approaches. Moreover, Flutterâ€™s HTTP library to connect our mobile app with the backend smoothly was incredibly valuable. Also, importing new libraries for style or other purposes is straightforward. With easy integration of these libraries into our Dart code, we enhance the functionality and aesthetics of our application. As a small mobile team of four, our experience with Flutter was positive and enriching. It gave us confidence and enhanced our skills in using this powerful framework for mobile development.

#### **5.1.6.2. VS Code**<a name="VSCode" />
Upon downloading the Flutter and Dart extensions, we found the IDE to be incredibly efficient. The built-in emulator eliminated the need for a separate download, and its speed is great. The combination of VSCode's quick response and Flutter's hot reload feature enhances the development process. Additionally, the Git functionality within VSCode is really user-friendly. For building .apk file of our application, the process was not easy with VSCode and we did that part with Android Studio. However, overall, the simplicity of setup, fast emulation, and smooth integration with Flutter's hot reload, coupled with intuitive Git support, make Visual Studio Code an excellent choice for Flutter development.
#### **5.1.6.3. Android Studio**<a name="AndroidStudio" />
Using Android Studio for Flutter development has its ups and downs. The initial setup process was  cumbersome and challenging for us, requiring downloads for both the IDE and a separate emulator that tends to be slow. However, once set up, the overall usage of Android Studio for Flutter is satisfactory. The IDE offers a comprehensive environment, but the contrast in setup ease and emulator speed compared to other options makes it a bit less user-friendly. Despite this, the Git functionality and build feature of Android Studio is great, providing a positive aspect to the overall development experience.

###  **5.1.7. Tools for Frontend Team**<a name="frontend" />

#### **5.1.7.1. Javascript & React.js**<a name="Javascript&React.js" />

As students in web development, we've found that both JavaScript and React are beginner-friendly, enabling gradual improvement. JavaScript's straightforward handling of data types, variables, and functions allows us to start with the basics and progress to more advanced concepts. React's component-based structure also supports step-by-step learning, starting with simple components and moving on to more complex user interfaces. Extensive documentation and a helpful developer community make it easier to advance our skills, helping us tackle increasingly challenging web development projects with confidence.

JavaScript is a versatile and essential language for building interactive web applications. JavaScript provides us with the building blocks we need, such as variables, functions, control structures, and DOM manipulation, making it easier to work with various data types and create responsive web pages. When it comes to React, we've discovered that it's a game-changer. React's components, virtual DOM, JSX, and state management with props and state have streamlined our UI development process. These features, combined with tools like React Router and the Context API, enable us to create dynamic and engaging user interfaces. Starting with straightforward projects and gradually delving into these features has helped us gain confidence and expertise in using JavaScript and React for web development.

#### **5.1.7.2. Prettier**<a name="Prettier" />

As the frontend team, we have found Prettier to be a valuable tool for simplifying and improving our coding practices. Prettier's simplicity and ease of use make it particularly appealing for learners. It automates the often tedious task of code formatting, allowing us to focus on mastering coding skills rather than memorizing style rules. Its role in eliminating code style debates within project teams enhances collaboration, an essential aspect of our education. Prettier's integration with popular code editors and version control systems aligns well with our needs, while its consistent code formatting helps us develop good coding habits early in our learning journey, making it an indispensable tool for students.

#### **5.1.7.3. Eslint**<a name="Eslint" />

We have found it to be a highly valuable asset for maintaining code quality and adherence to best practices. ESLint enforces coding standards and identifies errors and potential issues in our JavaScript code, which is particularly beneficial as learners still refining their coding skills. Its customization options and integration with popular code editors make it versatile and easy to adopt, aligning with our needs as students. By automating code quality checks, ESLint assisted us in catching and resolving issues early, promoting a cleaner and more reliable codebase. Overall, ESLint played a significant role in our education by instilling coding best practices, improving code quality, and facilitating efficient teamwork. Its cause on errors have been annoying but, it was relatively benefical for code understandibility and optimization.

#### **5.1.7.4. Material-UI**<a name="Material-UI" />


Material-UI was a good choice for several reasons. We had used in practice application in CMPE352 and this experience was one of the important reasons behind selecting MUI. We like how Material-UI integrated well with it, making the learning process relatively straightforward. The library of pre-designed, customizable UI components have been a big time-saver, allowing us to focus on building features instead of starting from scratch. Furthermore, Material-UI's focus on responsive design and accessibility ensured that our project could appeal to a wide audience and functioned well on various devices. The community support, customization options, and integration with state management libraries provided valuable learning experiences, improving our web development skills and preparing us for potential job opportunities in the future.

#### **5.1.7.5. Visual Studio Code**<a name="VSC" />

Based on our previous experience with various development tools, we consider Visual Studio Code (VS Code) an excellent choice for our frontend development and JavaScript projects. Its user-friendly interface is easy to navigate, and we appreciate the abundance of extensions and plugins available. The intelligent code suggestions and autocompletion make coding in JavaScript a breeze, and the integrated Git support simplifies version control. We also love the specialized extensions for frontend frameworks like React, which helps us see real-time changes as we work on our projects. With VS Code, we can ensure our code adheres to best practices with automatic code formatting and linting. It's a valuable tool that enhances our productivity and makes the development process more efficient and enjoyable.

#### **5.1.7.5. Docker**<a name="Docker" />

Docker is much valuable asset for frontend development. Docker's containerization capabilities provide us with a consistent and reproducible environment, ensuring that our applications run consistently across various development and production setups. With Docker, we can package our frontend applications and their dependencies into containers, making it easier to collaborate with team members and deploy our projects. It also simplifies the setup and configuration process, reducing the "it works on my machine" problem. Furthermore, Docker enables us to isolate our frontend applications from the underlying infrastructure, enhancing security and minimizing conflicts. This results in a streamlined and efficient frontend development workflow, ultimately saving us time and ensuring that our applications are ready for deployment with ease.

To regular use of it, prevented mistakes we encountered at the working process. We realized that version differences cause too problems even for three people, so we decided to run program with running Docker.

#### **5.1.7.7. Amazon AWS**<a name="Amazon-AWS" />

AWS offers a wide range of services that can be integrated into our development and deployment processes. With AWS, we have hosted our frontend applications in a scalable and secure environment, ensuring high availability and performance. We appreciate the flexibility of AWS, which allows us to choose from various compute, storage, and database options, tailoring our infrastructure to our specific project requirements. AWS also provides tools for monitoring, scaling, and optimizing our applicat-----ions, which are essential for maintaining a robust frontend. The accessibility and documentation of AWS make it a powerful tool for our development needs, and its cloud services significantly contribute to our success in delivering efficient and reliable frontend applications.

We encountered with memory problem in ec2 services and frontend side of the project, but we handled the problem, which was one of the critical issues for us in first milestone.

#### **5.1.7.8. Github Actions**<a name="Github-Actions" />

GitHub Actions has significantly improved our frontend development. With its automation capabilities integrated smoothly into our GitHub repositories, where we use both main and development branches, we can set up CI/CD pipelines that ensure our code quality and reliability. Every time we push new code, GitHub Actions automatically runs tests, checks, and deploys to various environments, providing early feedback and preventing issues from reaching production. The versatility of actions from the community allows us to tailor our workflows to our specific needs, making our frontend development more efficient and streamlined. GitHub Actions has become an invaluable part of our toolkit, helping us deliver high-quality applications with ease and consistency.

### **5.1.8. Tools For Backend Team**<a name="backend" />
#### **5.1.8.1. GitHub**<a name="backend-github" />

We have effectively utilized GitHub as our central platform for version control.  Pull requests and issues helped us to carry on a structural development process. We created new branches for our development issues and created pull requests before merging the new branch into development branch which is used as main branch for our development process.  Additionally, the use of GitHub Projects has allowed us to create a project plan and track the progress of development tasks, ensuring efficient task management and clear visibility into project milestones. We used GitHub Wiki for storing our deliverables. Furthermore, we have implemented CI/CD pipelines in GitHub Actions to automate the deployment of our backend application, ensuring a streamlined and efficient release process. Additionally, a dedicated test pipeline which runs unit tests for the backend has been set up to automatically run when a pull request for the backend is opened, allowing for the timely identification and resolution of potential issues during the development phase.

#### **5.1.8.2 Docker**<a name="backend-docker" />

The integration of Docker in our project facilitates the process of deploying and managing application containers. By encapsulating the application and its dependencies into containers, Docker has facilitated consistent deployment across different environments, ensuring that the software behaves consistently regardless of the deployment platform. This has significantly enhanced the reproducibility of our development and deployment processes, enabling a more efficient and reliable workflow.  We also used docker to create a container which serves as a host for database of our application.

#### **5.1.8.3 AWS EC2**<a name ="backend-aws-ec2" />

We used the EC2 service of AWS to host our application on the cloud. Thanks to free tier feature of AWS, we utilized micro ec2 instances to deploy our backend api for free.  AWS provides a dashboard for EC2 which enables us to easily manage and monitor our instances.

#### **5.1.8.4 NestJS**<a name ="backend-nestjs" />

NestJS is chosen as the backend framework for our project. Its modular architecture and reliance on TypeScript have made easier the development process by providing a strong structure for building efficient and scalable server-side applications. Its powerful dependency injection system has enabled us to create well-organized and maintainable code. The included structures such as guards, interceptors, and filters also increases the maintainability of code. Also, the annotations for swagger documentation are speeding up the api documentation process.

#### **5.1.8.5 PostgreSQL**<a name ="backend-postgresql" />

PostgreSQL has been selected as the database management system for our project. Its robust features, including support for complex queries, transactions, and data integrity, have provided a solid foundation for handling our data storage and retrieval requirements. Additionally, its compatibility with the nestjs typeorm library helps us to run database queries via an interface.

## **5.2. Evaluation of Processes**<a name="evaluation-of-processes" />

### **5.2.1. Team Meetings**<a name="team-meetings" />

Our team has held meetings once or twice a week so far. The purpose of these meetings was to discuss project progress, address challenges, doing think-tank processes and plan next steps.

Our team meetings were well-structured and organized. Before each meeting, team members were encouraged to write down topics they felt should be discussed. By doing that we aim to shorten weeklymeeting times. During the meeting, a moderator guided the discussion, making sure that everyone had a chance to contribute and every topic was discussed. A designated note-taker kept track of the topics discussed and the decisions made. This helped keep the meeting on track and ensure that everyone was focused on the same objectives. And furthermore, we ensured that our colleagues who couldn't attend the meetings due to certain mandatory reasons stay updated.

The status of the tasks was discussed during each meeting. New tasks were identified and assigned to team members. This helped ensure that
everyone had a clear understanding of what needed to be done and who was responsible for each task. Furthermore, any questions were addressed by explaining the shortcuts that can be used in their respective responsibilities. Additionally, the note-taker published the meeting notes to the GitHub wiki, which helped ensure that all team
members were aware of what was discussed and the tasks assigned.

### **5.2.2. PS & Customer Meetings**<a name="ps-customer-meetings" />

We communicated with our assistant, Alper AhmetoÄŸlu, via the assigned channel on Discord throughout the project if we had any problems or
needed comments on our weekly assignments, and we benefited from his feedback. The discussions we had during the course and the arguments provided by the project groups for their work were also helpful in the project process. We presented our requirements which were examined and assessed by the assistants, who provided us with helpful input.

Additionally, We presented our project to the client during the meeting at October 31, and took notes for the necessary work to further enhance our project, in light of the feedback received from the client. Our presentation allowed us to better understand the client's preferences, thereby enabling us to identify more clearly the areas in which our project might be lacking. We focused on improving our project with the questions posed by the client.


### **5.2.3. Issue Management**<a name="issue-management" />

Our team has effectively utilized GitHub issues for managing the tasks in the project process. By assigning a reviewer to each issue and labeling them
with colored tags based on type(wiki, design, research etc.), status(new, on_hold, in_progress etc.), priority(low, high, urgent etc.), and effort(low, high etc.) required, we have been able to efficiently track and manage progress. Additionally, we have been using an issue template, prepared by Melih Gezer at the last term, to ensure consistency in the way issues are reported and managed.Moreover, through issue management, we endeavored to stay informed about the changes in our code and ensure coordination between the frontend, backend, and mobile teams which all are using differant substructure.

To sum up, the approach to issue management in GitHub appears to be well-organized and effective for the needs of our project and also to develop of our team organization.

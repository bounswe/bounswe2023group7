**Team Name:** Group 7  
**Date:** 12.12.2023  

## Progress Summary
We had a productive week, achieving milestones such as completing the Entity Page, like/dislike/edit/delete threads/comments in the frontend, search functionality in the forums page, and also making texts selectable in the mobile. Tasks like Edit/Delete Review and refactoring were partially done, while a Like/Dislike Bug was successfully addressed. Progress was made on mobile app navigation, with the Main Search Page implemented and backend endpoints like Group and Game-related ones completed. Forum-related tasks and annotation searching were also tackled.

In thr following week, we will be doing various tasks including implementing new features like user types, refining existing functionalities such as image size troubleshooting, enhancing search capabilities for games and threads in the mobile, revising user profile pages, and conducting frontend and mobile team peer testing. We will complete group related features in the UI and annotation implementation in the backend. The focus is on refining, adding, and testing features across different sections of the platform to ensure a seamless and enriched user interaction.

## Planned vs. Actual

**Mobile Team:** 
For the Edit/Delete Review, Thread and Comment issue, only the review part is remained, since it was a big issue for a week. And for the Main Search page in the mobile app only thread(post) search remained uncompleted since it was also a big issue to be completed in 6 hours.

For entities of a game, after the discussion between mobile and frontend teams, we decided to add user defined entity properties. We changed bottomNavigationBar in the mobile app. It was forcing us to redeclare the widget with all its parameters again and again to change its structure. We changed it to a customized widget so that only changing widget's own structure is sufficient now.

**Frontend team:**
In the frontend, the filter and sort in the search required more discussion so the task will be completed in the following week after the discussion in the lab with the other complementary features in the search such as general search bar in the header.

The group page design and implementation will be completed in the following week, it is still under development. It will be completed with the other group features such as groups page and create a group page that has 2 weeks deadline.

## Risks
There are two weeks left to the final milestone, we are in hurry. While implementing the new features, we also need to protect the maintanence of the project while testing all the features. The risk is that it may be hard to keep our tempo steady and complete all the tasks. May the force be with us 💪

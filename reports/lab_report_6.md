## Risks
Since we have lots of things to do, we may struggle on completing the planned issues.


## UI/UX 

### Ideas
- Having 3D versions of the characters within the gaming platform would be a valuable addition.
- Incorporating videos into forum posts would be beneficial, providing assistance to users dealing with challenging episodes in gameplay.

### Our Implementation
- The presence of a bottom navigation bar enhances accessibility in the mobile app, providing significant convenience for users.
- The utilization of a darker color palette enhances the user experience, particularly catering to the preferences of our potential users, gamers, who favor the dark theme. This deliberate choice contributes to an improved overall aesthetic and usability.
- We have created a input section in game profile page for user to enter his/her completion duration of game. This feature helps user to guess his own completion duration and he will also be able to refer that in which parts of the game he is.

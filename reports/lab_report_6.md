## Progress Summary

We had a productive week, successfully completing tasks such as implementing endpoints, updating user information, and designing the home page. Backend connections for mobile features, like forgot password and game follow/unfollow, were also achieved. However, tasks related to reviews are still in progress, along with ongoing work on game pages and mobile functionalities. Overall, we are on track to meet the project's objectives by addressing both frontend and backend development tasks.

In the upcoming week, we planned to update the RAM excel, implement token authentication for mobile requests, games and forums page for frontend and conduct annotation research. Design enhancements for the mobile app, along with significant backend additions such as comment, post implementation and rate game features, are also on the agenda. These efforts are geared towards achieving substantial progress and meeting project deadlines.

## Risks
Since we have lots of things to do, we may struggle on completing the planned issues.


## UI/UX 

### Ideas
- Having 3D versions of the characters within the gaming platform would be a valuable addition.
- Incorporating videos into forum posts would be beneficial, providing assistance to users dealing with challenging episodes in gameplay.

### Our Implementation
- The presence of a bottom navigation bar enhances accessibility in the mobile app, providing significant convenience for users.
- The utilization of a darker color palette enhances the user experience, particularly catering to the preferences of our potential users, gamers, who favor the dark theme. This deliberate choice contributes to an improved overall aesthetic and usability.
- We have added an input section on the game profile page that allows users to input their estimated completion duration for a game. This feature helps users estimate how long it might take to finish the game and enables them to track their progress within different parts of the game based on their completion duration input.

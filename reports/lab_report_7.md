**Team Name:** Group 7  
**Date:** 21.11.2023  

## Progress Summary

We tackled various backend and frontend tasks, including implementing game-related functionalities, user profile pages, and forum features. Significant efforts were dedicated to enhancing mobile app usability, modifying icons, and refining page designs. Progress was made on crucial aspects such as review creation, editing, liking, disliking, and deletion functionalities.

Various team members will actively contribute to different aspects of the game page's enhancement, including backend and frontend developments. Significant strides will be made in refining user profile pages and implementing vital endpoints related to game functionalities. The focus extended to improving search capabilities within both games and forums, alongside adjustments to improve app visibility and accessibility for unregistered users. Additionally, efforts were dedicated to refining specific features like tag systems, review components, and the home page, ensuring a more intuitive and comprehensive user experience.

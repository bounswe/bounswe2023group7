| Elif Kızılkaya   | During the first milestone, my focus was on setting up Docker, managing the deployment processes, constructing the action pipeline, and contributing to the project's structural planning. I developed pages with mock datas for our project components such as home page, forum page; and general frontend layout (sidebar & header as well) and actively participated in the pre-release phase of our software, including preparing the milestone report and presentation materials, also participated in the milestone demo. Also, I revised the previous semester's use case and class diagrams with Hatice Erk and Kardelen Erdal. For the second milestone, I shifted my attention to designing and implementing key pages such as the "Create Game" and "Forums" pages, ensuring they were well-integrated with the backend. This included creating a form for game creation and adding search bar to the Forums page. I also redesigned the homepage based on user feedback, enhancing the user experience through UI improvements and implementing new features like thread commenting. I implemented thread page and commenting, also revised sidebar and header. I participaed in milestone report preparation and presentation materials, also presented the milestone demo with Hatice Erk and Kardelen Erdal.  As we progressed to the third milestone, my efforts were concentrated on implementing image and text annotations within various sections, such as threads (image & text), comments (text), and game bios (text). I consistently updated the homepage and sidebar to incorporate new features and feedback such as trending topics and footer to the layout. Additionally, I tackled several frontend bugs, developed the footer, and introduced the "Upcoming Title" feature, which displayed launch dates and demo links for upcoming games. My role also extended to revising existing components like threads and comments, integrating functionalities like editing, deleting, liking, and disliking. Furthermore, I enhanced the search functionality and topics part on the forums page and was involved in preparing user scenarios for our final demo presentation. To ensure a comprehensive demonstration of our platform's capabilities, I created a variety of games, threads, entities, and groups. I took part in preparing milestone report and presenting final milestone demo. Also, I prepated final video with Kardelen Erdal and Hatice Erk. |
| Kardelen Erdal | Throughout Milestone 1, I collaborated with my team on various tasks, including revising the class diagram, implementing the home page, and finalizing the design of the mobile application. I took charge of creating the log in and sign-up pages, added a splash screen and a sidebar with log in/out buttons, and developed an API service to connect with the backend. We successfully generated the .apk file for Milestone 1, accompanied by detailed instructions in the ReadMe.md file. In Milestone 2, my responsibilities were implementing features such as the Forgot Password Page, Create Game Pages, Edit Game Pages, and Create Entity Page. I also made research on how to use annotations in a Flutter app. I collaborated with team members to refine the user interface based on feedback, improved password visibility, and integrated default images for games. For Milestone 3, I designed and implemented the Entities Page, Entity Page, and Annotation features. I implemented text annotations for threads, comments, games and entities. I added an info box to the user profile page. Alongside team members, I recorded a video for deliverables, and ensured the final .apk file was ready. For the three customer presentations, I took charge in preparing a user scenario and I presented the mobile part in every one of them. Throughout the term, I constantly delete the mock data in database since all our team members insert mock data to test our features. In every milestone, I fixed some bugs and I reviewed PRs, resolved conflicts in them. I and Elif Kızılkaya were always in touch throughout the term to make the frontend and mobile app compatible.|    
|Fatma Sena Alçı|Until the first milestone, we generally completed the deficiencies in the planning of our project and made changes. In this context, I prepared a sequence diagram for the game. As we started the implementation, collaboration with the mobile team was crucial because no one had a Flutter background. I completed the sign-up page backend integration. I created RAM to monitor our progress. The second milestone was when we implemented the main features. I integrated the change password and edit user profile page features into the mobile app. I created the game page and took care of its design. To enhance the user interface, I reworked the design of game pages for games without photos and implemented scrollable tags. I contributed to making our application realistic by creating meaningful posts, comments and real games. In order to improve the user experience, I edited the navigation of many pages to prevent reloading upon using the back button. Also I added photos to the drawer and resolved several bugs. I added user related recommended games for registered users and game related recommended games for each game. I created a new page called "Upcoming Titles," completed its integration, and added it to the homepage in addition to its own page. I helped fix last minute bugs that occurred while creating the apk for the final release.|
|Muhammet Tayyip Kamiloğlu|Throughout the project milestones, I played a pivotal role in updating and maintaining our documentation, ensuring its compatibility with the new semester and team members. I actively participated in reviewing and updating last semester's requirements, incorporating mockups for new features such as the entity page and an enhanced Game page. As a frontend developer, I implemented crucial functionalities like login, signup, and logout for the web application, addressing bugs and reviewing code written by teammates in milestone 1. In milestone 2, I focused on bolstering our system's security with the implementation of a change password page and contributed significantly to the expansion of our forum capabilities by designing the create thread page. Additionally, I played a key role in the completion and submission of the lab 5 report on GitHub, incorporating a show password feature for improved accessibility. The final milestone saw the successful implementation of a 'create entity' page, detailed search features for games and forums, and the integration of suggested games sections. I also delved into enhancing user engagement through the addition of an annotation feature and a semantic search attempt. Notable additions include a group page, an 'upcoming titles' component, and a versatile 'GameCard' component for improved game information presentation.
| Furkan Ülke | Throughout the project, my contributions were pivotal in enhancing the mobile application's functionality and user experience. Notably, I created a custom bottomNavigationBar widget, providing crucial flexibility to the app's navigation. Emphasizing user-centric design, I meticulously designed and implemented the search landing page, detailed game search, and post search functionalities. The game search allows users to explore titles based on various criteria such as title, tags, and platform, with added filtering and sorting options for a seamless experience. Similarly, the post search enables users to find posts by owner, title, tags, and more, with corresponding filtering and sorting capabilities. My focus extended to user-centric features, including the design and implementation of a user search feature. Users can now be easily located by their usernames, and a search result summary displays pertinent information such as avatar, full username, full name, and user role—facilitating efficient user discovery. Resolving image scale issues in the mobile app, I optimized the UI by setting game images as background in a transparent manner, ensuring a visually perfect Games page. Moreover, I introduced a last activity section for users, enhancing the profile page with visibility into a user's recent actions. For comprehensive project documentation, I played a crucial role in preparing UI/UX details for the final milestone report, listing all mobile app functionalities with images and providing source code links for each feature. Additionally, I crafted a user manual, offering clear instructions for users on all possible actions within the mobile app, ensuring a user-friendly and informative experience. |
|Yunus Emre Altuğ| Throughout the project I was a member of frontend team. I had main role in game page and home page before milestone 1. (Home page did not remain as that) Both pages' general structure were implemented by me. After milestone 1, I added dynamic parts of the game page such as following, reviews, liking, disliking reviews, rating, game duration submittance. Also I created profile page. Additionally I integrated edit profile in profile page. Both profile page and game page are revised by me whenever it is needed usually. Before milestone 2, I completed most part of the game page and profile page. After milestone 2, I created the groups page, create group page and entity page. On groups page I implemented, search, filter, sorting and pagination structure to get relevant groups. Furthermore, I designed the group topics which enable user to be linked to groups. I also played a role in implementing annotations. I implemented game story and game guide annotations in game page. Except frontend developments, with Elif and Şafak we dockerized and deployed our platforms. Also we did CI/CD integration.|
|Ömer Şafak Bebek| Throughout the project, I was a member of the backend team. Until the first milestone, mainly I was responsible for creating the codebase and dockerization and deployment of the backend application. I also helped our frontend team to deploy the web application. I have created basic user endpoints and an authentication & authorization system. I also created the required endpoints for the following system. After milestone 1, my most important contribution was creating all post related endpoints for our forum feature. I also created a detailed game search endpoint, game completion duration endpoints, entity related endpoints, and a search endpoint for the search bar on the header. Additionally, I fixed some issues with the upload endpoint. After milestone 2, I created all group related endpoints. Also, I created annotation and semantic search servers and deployed them. I added endpoints for image and text annotations with Burak. I created a search endpoint that utilizes our semantic search server. Also, I fixed our deployment environment for the backend application by carrying it to a more powerful instance on Digital Ocean servers (it was collapsing beforehand).| 
|Hatice Erk| In Milestone 1, the new team member took essential steps to integrate into the project by familiarizing themselves with both the team and the project repository. They created a wiki profile page, participated in technology research for the mobile team, and collaborated on revising class and use case diagrams. Communication plans were updated, and mockups were enhanced with new pages. The team initiated the project with a home page design, organized folder structures, and optimized the repository by updating the .gitignore. Design decisions were made in meetings with team members, including discussions on logo, fonts, and color palette. Preparations for the customer milestone presentation were made, leading to the creation of a pre-release version for the first milestone. In Milestone 2, contributions included lab reports, updates to the Android app icon and name, and the creation of a forum with backend connections. Various pages and functionalities, such as thread creation, reviews, and comments, were implemented. Navigation and bug fixes were addressed, and the user profile was updated. The team prepared for the customer presentation and created a pre-release version. Milestone 3 involved contributions to lab reports, the completion of group functionalities, and the implementation of group-related pages and features. Thread and comment edit/delete functions were added, and important bugs were fixed. Collaboration with team members on the .apk and release version was carried out, and a scenario for the milestone report was written. The team produced a video for the milestone report, showcasing their achievements throughout the project.|

- We added image annotation to our application. The image of thread posts can be annotated.
- We improved our search functionalities. Users were able to search games in second release. In this release, users also can search forums, groups. These searchs have filtering and sorting also. Additionally, user both use autocomplete game search or filtered game search. Beyond, user can reach a general search for users, forums, games and groups on header.
- We added recommendations to our platform. Mainly, it suggests game based on user's activity on the site. It can be seen from the home page. Additionally to reach users which want to play similar games, we added suggested games content on related games of a game. One can see similar games of a game. 
- We revised our profile page. We introduced user types on user interface. As mentioned above, developers can create upcoming title posts. From their profile page they can share additionally their companies and edit them. Besides, user's groups can be seen from the profile page.

### Known Bugs

Web:
* Users cannot give a relevant description for entities while creating it.
* Users cannot edit their comments.
* Users cannot see the area entities of the games.
* On the forums page, the forum topics does not a give profile photo and a nickname as desired.

Mobile:
* Users cannot upload file from their Android devices only provide a link.
* Users cannot delete their annotations from mobile app.
* When a thread is searched, the back button redirects to the game page of the thread, not the search page.

Backend:
* Semantic search struggles to find, so relevance score reduced from 0.5 to 0.3 in deployed server.

These bugs are fixed on deployed web server, but in release their bugs are stayed.

## **Annotations**

### **Web:**
* ***Status:*** In our project, annotations have been successfully implemented across various sections, enhancing user interaction and content engagement. This includes *image annotations* for *thread images* and *text annotations* for game bios, stories, guides, trivia in the *game page*; entity descriptions in the *entity page*; thread texts, and comments in the *thread page*. This implementation has been tailored to foster a more interactive and informative experience for users, allowing them to add, view, and delete annotations in multiple pages within the platform.
* ***Compliance with W3C WADM:*** Our implementation strictly adheres to the W3C Web Annotation Data Model (WADM) standards. This compliance ensures that our annotation system is robust, interoperable, and aligns with global web standards. By following WADM, we've created a system where annotations are not only consistent across different parts of our platform but also potentially compatible with other systems using the same standards.
    * *According to W3C WADM, an annotation should consist of a body, a target, and context data. Here's how our implementation aligns with this:*
      ```
      // Format Annotation Data (example from your text annotation implementation)
        const formatAnnotationData = (annotation) => {
          return {
            "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld",
            type: "Annotation",
            body: {
                type: "TextualBody",
                value: annotation.body[0].value,
                purpose: "commenting"
            },
            target: {
                source: window.location.href,
                selector: {
                    start: annotation.target.selector[1].start,
                    end: annotation.target.selector[1].end
                }
            }
            };
        };
        ```
            In this function:
            @context specifies the JSON-LD context for W3C WADM. 
            type is set to "Annotation".
            body contains the content of the annotation, its type, and purpose.
            target identifies where the annotation applies, including the source (URL) and the text selector (start and end positions).
                    
        * Our project uses RESTful API calls to interact with annotations. Here's an example that aligns with WADM standards:
         ```
        // Send Annotation Data to Server
        const sendAnnotationData = async (data, method) => {
            try {
            const url =`http://${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/annotation/post/{threadId}`;
            const response = await axios.post(url, data);
            console.log(`Annotation ${method}d:`, response.data);
            } catch (error) {
            console.error(`Error ${method}ing annotation:`, error);
          }
      };
    ```
    In this function:
    Annotations are sent to the server using a POST request.
    The annotation data is structured in accordance with WADM, ensuring consistency and standardization.
    The server endpoint (/annotation/post/{threadId}) is designed to receive and process annotations in the WADM format.
* ***Implementation description***
1. **Image Annotations (Thread Page):** Implemented using the Annotorious library, we enabled users to annotate images in thread sections. Users can add comments to selected parts of an image and delete them, enhancing the visual content with interactive and informative notes.

2. **Text Annotations (Game Page & Entity Page):** For game-related content like bios, stories, guides, and trivia, as well as entity descriptions, we utilized the Recogito library. This feature allows users to highlight text segments and add and delete annotations, offering insights or additional information relevant to the selected text.

3. **Thread and Comment Annotations (Thread Page):** The thread and comments sections of the project are equipped with text annotation capabilities. This feature enhances user engagement, allowing users to create and delete annotations.

    **Technical Details:**

    * For initializing annotations, we ensured the DOM elements were available and used *useEffect* hooks for setup.
    * *useRef* was employed to manage the annotation instances, ensuring they are correctly initialized and destroyed based on the component lifecycle.
    * We included functions such as *onAnnotationCreated* and *onAnnotationDeleted* to handle annotation interactions.
    * AJAX calls via axios were used to interact with our backend, adhering to the WADM structure in our API requests and responses.

### **Mobile:**
* ***Status:*** In our mobile application, we have successfully integrated annotations into various content sections, including *Thread content, Comment content, Entity Description, and Game Bio content*. Currently, text annotations are available for all these sections, except for image annotation, which has not been implemented. It's important to note that since we only show *Game Bio* field in Game Pages, annotation is applicable for that field only within the context of games. Users of any type have the ability to contribute annotations to these fields. Upon visiting a page that has at least one annotation, users will encounter the annotated text. A simple click on the annotated text triggers a pop-up, showing additional details about the annotation.
* ***Compliance with W3C WADM:*** As mobile team, we stick to the rules of the W3C Web Annotation Data Model (WADM) to make sure our annotation system works well. This means our system is strong, can work with other systems, and follows the same rules as the entire web. The annotations in mobile and frontend work compatible thanks to this system.
* ***Implementation description:*** In Flutter, we didn't use any library to handle the annotation functionalities. The text annotation in specified pages and fields are very similar to each other. So, I will use Game Bio for example.
For any annotatable field, we used *SelectableText.rich* property. We added an *Annotate* button to the context menu, which is the menu that shows up when you long press some text. When you click it and type the your annotation, you can click the *Create Annotation* button in the popup. When this button is pressed, the related function in our API Service is called, for example: 
```
apiService.createAnnotationGameBio(
                              widget.token,
                              widget.id,
                              annotatedText,
                              start,
                              end,
                              annotationText);
```
This sends a POST request to our backend server. 
```
 Future<http.Response> createAnnotationGameBio(
      String? authToken,
      String gameID,
      String source,
      int start,
      int end,
      String annotationBody) async {
    var uri = Uri.parse("$baseURL/annotation/gamebio/$gameID");

    final body = jsonEncode(<String, Object>{
      '@context': "",
      'type': "Annotation",
      'body': annotationBody,
      'target': {
        'source': source,
        'selector': {'start': start, 'end': end}
      }
    });
    final response = await http.post(uri, body: body, headers: {
      'content-type': "application/json",
      'Authorization': 'Bearer $authToken'
    });
    return response;
  }
```
For building a page that includes annotation, in the *initState()* function of that page, we send a GET request to the backend server to get the annotations in that page. After getting the annotations, we build the field with the annotated texts in a different background color. When the user clicks an annotated text, a box which shows the annotation details will pop up.

## **Management**

### Implemented Changes and their impact
1. Scenerio Strategy:

    In the first milestone demo, while preparing for scenorio, we focused on the wrong aspects such as persona and story. In the first presentation, we created a boy which wanted to search about a game. However, the scenerio was not effective on audience, so presentation seemed weak and criticized. Additionally some mishaps we encountered worsened our presentation.

    In the second milestone demo, we focused on the story side of the scenerio and improved our preperation. The scenerio was better than the first. The audience was more reactive to presentation and features are displayed with better scenerio telling. However the relationship between people in the scenerio was not quite related with game-spesific domain.
    
    In the third milestone demo, we created a more basic and game-spesific scenerio to show our features. Our belief is, we were able to show our features well and we impressed audience about our key features.
    
2. Web Home Page
    
    One of the critic issues was home page throughout term. In the presentation, customers asked mainly how homepage is related with games. We planned firstly home page would display forum topics related games. However, forum was not first main component of the platform. Additionally, the topics includes topics such as bugs, errors, so the customers requested from us to modify the home page. 
    
    In second milestone. we present a more combined homepage and at this time we did not get negative feedback. We continued to attach additional features and implemented a home page linked with groups, forums, and most importantly games.
    
3. Communication Between Teams
    
    In the first weeks of the term, the mobil and frontend teams did not communicate well. We got feedback that mobile and frontend were not coherent completely. Therefore as much as possible we decided to add together and implemented similarly.
    
4. Lab Hours Efficiency
    
    The the first labs we focused on deliverables instead of group communication. We was sharing our tasks and filling the report. However after first milestone, we started to discuss more about what we should have done and what we should do. We discussed together how functionalities should be developed in each lab. In short, we prioritize to detail our plan instead of task sharing and report writing. 
    

### Reflections related to your Final Milestone Demo

    
The general impression of the customers was good on our view. In this demo, we aimed to represent annotations, groups, game entities, recommendations and search functionality based features. These functionalities almost did not have a problem before the presentation and in the demo we could show them seamlessly.
    
The customers particularly expected to see these uncommon features from our application:
    - Text Annotation
    - Image Annotation
    - Semantic Search
The text and image annotations did not get a negative review. Especially our image annotation attracted attention. On the other hand, semantic search was not liked as annotations. Customers were not happy with it.
    

    

### Lessons Learned
    
What we could have change:
    
* The allocation of teams can be changed. However the team consists of 11 people, so we would deal with problems eventually. Backend team was not be able to share tasks evenly as mobile and frontend team. The effort usually belonged at most two people (especially, Ã–mer Åžafak).  
    
* We should not have lost time with mock datas. Sometimes frontend and mobile team we went ahead of backend. Therefore, connecting them also needed us to work on the same page. Additionally, some design choices made our job harder. Due to miscommunication, sometimes we did incompitable implementation between pages, and this caused to deal with them again.

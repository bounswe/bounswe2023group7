- We added image annotation to our application. The image of thread posts can be annotated.
- We improved our search functionalities. Users were able to search games in second release. In this release, users also can search forums, groups. These searchs have filtering and sorting also. Additionally, user both use autocomplete game search or filtered game search. Beyond, user can reach a general search for users, forums, games and groups on header.
- We added recommendations to our platform. Mainly, it suggests game based on user's activity on the site. It can be seen from the home page. Additionally to reach users which want to play similar games, we added suggested games content on related games of a game. One can see similar games of a game. 
- We revised our profile page. We introduced user types on user interface. As mentioned above, developers can create upcoming title posts. From their profile page they can share additionally their companies and edit them. Besides, user's groups can be seen from the profile page.

### Known Bugs

Web:
* Users cannot give a relevant description for entities while creating it.
* Users cannot edit their comments.
* Users cannot see the area entities of the games.
* On the forums page, the forum topics does not a give profile photo and a nickname as desired.

Mobile:
* Users cannot upload file from their Android devices only provide a link.
* Users cannot delete their annotations from mobile app.
* When a thread is searched, the back button redirects to the game page of the thread, not the search page.

Backend:
* Semantic search struggles to find, so relevance score reduced from 0.5 to 0.3 in deployed server.

These bugs are fixed on deployed web server, but in release their bugs are stayed.

## **Annotations**

### **Web:**
* ***Status:*** In our project, annotations have been successfully implemented across various sections, enhancing user interaction and content engagement. This includes *image annotations* for *thread images* and *text annotations* for game bios, stories, guides, trivia in the *game page*; entity descriptions in the *entity page*; thread texts, and comments in the *thread page*. This implementation has been tailored to foster a more interactive and informative experience for users, allowing them to add, view, and delete annotations in multiple pages within the platform.
* ***Compliance with W3C WADM:*** Our implementation strictly adheres to the W3C Web Annotation Data Model (WADM) standards. This compliance ensures that our annotation system is robust, interoperable, and aligns with global web standards. By following WADM, we've created a system where annotations are not only consistent across different parts of our platform but also potentially compatible with other systems using the same standards.
    * *According to W3C WADM, an annotation should consist of a body, a target, and context data. Here's how our implementation aligns with this:*
      ```
      // Format Annotation Data (example from your text annotation implementation)
        const formatAnnotationData = (annotation) => {
          return {
            "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld",
            type: "Annotation",
            body: {
                type: "TextualBody",
                value: annotation.body[0].value,
                purpose: "commenting"
            },
            target: {
                source: window.location.href,
                selector: {
                    start: annotation.target.selector[1].start,
                    end: annotation.target.selector[1].end
                }
            }
            };
        };
        ```
            In this function:
            @context specifies the JSON-LD context for W3C WADM. 
            type is set to "Annotation".
            body contains the content of the annotation, its type, and purpose.
            target identifies where the annotation applies, including the source (URL) and the text selector (start and end positions).
                    
        * Our project uses RESTful API calls to interact with annotations. Here's an example that aligns with WADM standards:
         ```
        // Send Annotation Data to Server
        const sendAnnotationData = async (data, method) => {
            try {
            const url =`http://${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/annotation/post/{threadId}`;
            const response = await axios.post(url, data);
            console.log(`Annotation ${method}d:`, response.data);
            } catch (error) {
            console.error(`Error ${method}ing annotation:`, error);
          }
      };
    ```
    In this function:
    Annotations are sent to the server using a POST request.
    The annotation data is structured in accordance with WADM, ensuring consistency and standardization.
    The server endpoint (/annotation/post/{threadId}) is designed to receive and process annotations in the WADM format.
* ***Implementation description***
1. **Image Annotations (Thread Page):** Implemented using the Annotorious library, we enabled users to annotate images in thread sections. Users can add comments to selected parts of an image and delete them, enhancing the visual content with interactive and informative notes.

2. **Text Annotations (Game Page & Entity Page):** For game-related content like bios, stories, guides, and trivia, as well as entity descriptions, we utilized the Recogito library. This feature allows users to highlight text segments and add and delete annotations, offering insights or additional information relevant to the selected text.

3. **Thread and Comment Annotations (Thread Page):** The thread and comments sections of the project are equipped with text annotation capabilities. This feature enhances user engagement, allowing users to create and delete annotations.

    **Technical Details:**

    * For initializing annotations, we ensured the DOM elements were available and used *useEffect* hooks for setup.
    * *useRef* was employed to manage the annotation instances, ensuring they are correctly initialized and destroyed based on the component lifecycle.
    * We included functions such as *onAnnotationCreated* and *onAnnotationDeleted* to handle annotation interactions.
    * AJAX calls via axios were used to interact with our backend, adhering to the WADM structure in our API requests and responses.

### **Mobile:**
* ***Status:*** In our mobile application, we have successfully integrated annotations into various content sections, including *Thread content, Comment content, Entity Description, and Game Bio content*. Currently, text annotations are available for all these sections, except for image annotation, which has not been implemented. It's important to note that since we only show *Game Bio* field in Game Pages, annotation is applicable for that field only within the context of games. Users of any type have the ability to contribute annotations to these fields. Upon visiting a page that has at least one annotation, users will encounter the annotated text. A simple click on the annotated text triggers a pop-up, showing additional details about the annotation.
* ***Compliance with W3C WADM:*** As mobile team, we stick to the rules of the W3C Web Annotation Data Model (WADM) to make sure our annotation system works well. This means our system is strong, can work with other systems, and follows the same rules as the entire web. The annotations in mobile and frontend work compatible thanks to this system.
* ***Implementation description:*** In Flutter, we didn't use any library to handle the annotation functionalities. The text annotation in specified pages and fields are very similar to each other. So, I will use Game Bio for example.
For any annotatable field, we used *SelectableText.rich* property. We added an *Annotate* button to the context menu, which is the menu that shows up when you long press some text. When you click it and type the your annotation, you can click the *Create Annotation* button in the popup. When this button is pressed, the related function in our API Service is called, for example: 
```
apiService.createAnnotationGameBio(
                              widget.token,
                              widget.id,
                              annotatedText,
                              start,
                              end,
                              annotationText);
```
This sends a POST request to our backend server. 
```
 Future<http.Response> createAnnotationGameBio(
      String? authToken,
      String gameID,
      String source,
      int start,
      int end,
      String annotationBody) async {
    var uri = Uri.parse("$baseURL/annotation/gamebio/$gameID");

    final body = jsonEncode(<String, Object>{
      '@context': "",
      'type': "Annotation",
      'body': annotationBody,
      'target': {
        'source': source,
        'selector': {'start': start, 'end': end}
      }
    });
    final response = await http.post(uri, body: body, headers: {
      'content-type': "application/json",
      'Authorization': 'Bearer $authToken'
    });
    return response;
  }
```
For building a page that includes annotation, in the *initState()* function of that page, we send a GET request to the backend server to get the annotations in that page. After getting the annotations, we build the field with the annotated texts in a different background color. When the user clicks an annotated text, a box which shows the annotation details will pop up.

## **Management**

### Implemented Changes and their impact
1. Scenerio Strategy:

    In the first milestone demo, while preparing for scenorio, we focused on the wrong aspects such as persona and story. In the first presentation, we created a boy which wanted to search about a game. However, the scenerio was not effective on audience, so presentation seemed weak and criticized. Additionally some mishaps we encountered worsened our presentation.

    In the second milestone demo, we focused on the story side of the scenerio and improved our preperation. The scenerio was better than the first. The audience was more reactive to presentation and features are displayed with better scenerio telling. However the relationship between people in the scenerio was not quite related with game-spesific domain.
    
    In the third milestone demo, we created a more basic and game-spesific scenerio to show our features. Our belief is, we were able to show our features well and we impressed audience about our key features.
    
2. Web Home Page
    
    One of the critic issues was home page throughout term. In the presentation, customers asked mainly how homepage is related with games. We planned firstly home page would display forum topics related games. However, forum was not first main component of the platform. Additionally, the topics includes topics such as bugs, errors, so the customers requested from us to modify the home page. 
    
    In second milestone. we present a more combined homepage and at this time we did not get negative feedback. We continued to attach additional features and implemented a home page linked with groups, forums, and most importantly games.
    
3. Communication Between Teams
    
    In the first weeks of the term, the mobil and frontend teams did not communicate well. We got feedback that mobile and frontend were not coherent completely. Therefore as much as possible we decided to add together and implemented similarly.
    
4. Lab Hours Efficiency
    
    The the first labs we focused on deliverables instead of group communication. We was sharing our tasks and filling the report. However after first milestone, we started to discuss more about what we should have done and what we should do. We discussed together how functionalities should be developed in each lab. In short, we prioritize to detail our plan instead of task sharing and report writing. 
    

### Reflections related to your Final Milestone Demo

    
The general impression of the customers was good on our view. In this demo, we aimed to represent annotations, groups, game entities, recommendations and search functionality based features. These functionalities almost did not have a problem before the presentation and in the demo we could show them seamlessly.
    
The customers particularly expected to see these uncommon features from our application:
    - Text Annotation
    - Image Annotation
    - Semantic Search
The text and image annotations did not get a negative review. Especially our image annotation attracted attention. On the other hand, semantic search was not liked as annotations. Customers were not happy with it.
    

    

### Lessons Learned
    
What we could have change:
    
* The allocation of teams can be changed. However the team consists of 11 people, so we would deal with problems eventually. Backend team was not be able to share tasks evenly as mobile and frontend team. The effort usually belonged at most two people (especially, Ã–mer Åžafak).  
    
* We should not have lost time with mock datas. Sometimes frontend and mobile team we went ahead of backend. Therefore, connecting them also needed us to work on the same page. Additionally, some design choices made our job harder. Due to miscommunication, sometimes we did incompitable implementation between pages, and this caused to deal with them again.

-  **Member**: Elif KÄ±zÄ±lkaya Group 7, Frontend
- **Responsibilities**: 
    - ***Milestone 1:***
    In the frontend team, my roles were diverse. I set up Docker, managed deployment processes, and planned the project structure. I created templates for our project components and updated them as our project evolved. Key frontend features like the forum page, sidebar, and header were developed by me. Alongside my team, I prepared materials and scenarios for the milestone presentation. My responsibilities also included the software's pre-release and preparing the milestone report.
    * ***Milestone 2:***
    My tasks involved designing and implementing the "Create Game" page, which I linked to the backend using a form. I also developed the Forums page, enabling search functionality and showcasing trending/latest topics, and added a "Forums" tab to the sidebar. Post-game creation, I was responsible for generating and redirecting to the related game page.
    I designed our homepage in Figma based on feedback and then implemented this design. I activated various buttons like "My Games," "My Groups," "Change Password," and "Create Game" in the header and sidebar. I also contributed to creating user scenarios for our team's presentation and demo, explained our Frontend during the presentation, and designed and implemented the Forum (thread) page, connecting it to the backend. I was responsible for the commenting feature on threads as well.
    * ***Milestone 3:***
    I conducted extensive research and implemented image annotation in threads and text annotation in threads, comments; and game bios in game page. I initially created the homepage and continually updated it throughout the semester based on feedback and backend endpoints such as trending games, trending topics also the latest topics in the forums page. The sidebar was regularly updated with new features like creating groups, threads, and games.
    I resolved various frontend bugs, such as issues with container height, routing, searching, and thread images. I also developed the footer layout and the "Upcoming Title" feature. I revised threads and comments, adding like/dislike/edit/delete functionality. The search feature on the forums page was another of my contributions.

            - Conducted a comprehensive research about annotations, found libraries to use, example codes, and after implementing I shared the insights of how to implement it to my team mates
            - With hatice and kardelen, I prepared a comprehensive user scenario to showcase our features in the final demo and presented it.
            - Implemented a footer for the layout for the users to connect to us for their complaints, wishes and suggestions, to also request to change their user type to developer or e-sport player.
            -	I designed and implemented upcoming titles feature on the frontend. I updated the thread component, forum topic and forum topic for game components to additionally display launching date and demo link when it is upcoming title. Also, updated the create a thread form to create a upcoming title if the user is a developer.
            -	I updated the profile page to include user type area, I designed 3 different icons to display if the user is gamer, developer, or e-sport player.
            -	Updated the create button to display a menu with the options: create thread, create game, and create group.
            -	I connected the latest topics part on forums page to backend to display the most recently opened threads.
            -	I implemented like/dislike/delete/edit thread and like/dislike/delete/edit comment.
            -	I implemened search functionality on forums page, connected it to backend.
            -	Created games, threads, entities, groups for the milestone demo.

- **Unit Tests:** I did not write unit test since I'm in the frontend team, we conducted manual testing.
- **Additional information**:   I presented the frontend part in milestone presentation and answered questions from the audience. I reviewed and tested the tasks done by the frontend team. I attended labs and general team meetings. On 25.12.2023, we checked everything and created the final release tag with Kardelen Erdal, Hatice Erk and Fatma Sena AlÃ§Ä±. I wrote the annotation part for web in the Final Report. As frontend and mobile teams, we were always in touch to be aligned and synced.


### Kardelen Erdal <a name="kardelen-erdal" />
-  **Member**: Kardelen Erdal - 2018400024 - Group 7 - Mobile Team
* **Responsibilities:** 
1.  **Milestone 1:**  I reviewed the class diagram and designed new sequence diagrams for annotation. I was responsible for communication in mobile team. I worked on implementing the home page from scratch and creating our folders with my team. After the design is reviewed with the frontend team, I was responsible for changing the log in page according to our decisions and connect log in and sign up buttons to the backend API. I implemented a splash screen for our application. I was assigned to task of implementing a sidebar in the home page which shows you if you're logged in or not. We also created .apk file for deliverables and I wrote our application's guide in ReadMe.md file. I prepared the milestone presentation materials and scenarios with my team.
2.  **Milestone 2:** I was assigned the task of Create Game and Edit Game pages. I implemented them from scratch and made revisions according to feedbacks and discussions. I connected the Forgot Password page to the backend endpoints. I was assigned to implement Entity related pages. I resolved some UI issues and missing fields that I saw in other pages like Games page, Search Game page, etc. I was assigned to make research on Annotation on Mobile Apps. I was responsible for removing the test data from the database. Also, I created .apk file with Hatice Erk and I was responsible for the mobile application part in the milestone presentation.
3.  **Milestone 3:** I have been mainly assigned to work on all the entity and annotation functionalities in mobile. I conducted research on Annotation. I also reviewed 16 PRs of my team and resolved conflicts in them. Again, I, Hatice Erk and Elif KÄ±zÄ±lkaya were responsible for the scenario, presentation and creating the final release.

* **Main contributions:** 
1.  **Milestone 1:** 
      - I was assigned to task of revising class diagram with other team members. We discussed and revised the class diagram according to the feedbacks and new requirements.
      - I worked on implementing the home page with my team. We also discussed about color theme and design of the mobile application.
      - We created the folder "mobile" and initialized the application inside it.
      - I implemented log in and sign up pages of Mobile Application.
      - I was assigned the task of Adding Annotation to Sequence Diagram.
      - I changed log in page style after the design is finalized by both mobile and frontend teams.
      - I created API Service using http library for login and signup to connect to backend API.
      - I added splash screen into the mobile application after our logo and color theme are finalized.
      - I added a sidebar with log in/out buttons to the mobile application which shows if the user is logged in or not. I implemented userProvider class for general usage.

      - Before Milestone 1 Presentation, we met face to face and create a creative user scenario and presentation. In the presentation, I presented the introduction part and also presented the log in, sign up and home page of mobile application.
2.  **Milestone 2:**
    - I implemented the Forgot Password Page with the backend connection using verifyCode and changePassword endpoints.
    - I implemented Create Game Pages. Firstly, I implemented all fields of a game in the same page, but according to the feedbacks and the discussion with Elif KÄ±zÄ±lkaya (Frontend), I divided Create Game into two pages for a better user experience.
    - I changed the location of Create Game button so that user can see it even if the page is scrolled.
    - In Login and Signup pages, the user was not able to see their password. I implemented a show/hide password button for those pages.
    - I added a default image for the games that have no coverlink.
    - I implemented Edit Game Pages and connected it to editGame endpoint. 
    - I implemented Create Entity Page with a backend connection, where user can access from the game page.
    - After the discussion with Elif KÄ±zÄ±lkaya (frontend), I made changes on the options in Create Game and Edit Game pages.
    - I and Hatice Erk, implemented the navigation to the user profile when clicked from threads, comments and reviews.
    - While testing our buttons and endpoints, we created lots of test data in our database. And those were seen in our mobile application. For the customer presentation, I removed all the dumb data from the database.
    - I and Hatice Erk created .apk file for the milestone report.

- **Unit Tests:** There is no Unit Test in our mobile application.
- **Additional information**: I presented the mobile part in milestone presentation and answered questions from the audience. I reviewed and tested the tasks done by the mobile team. I attended all lectures, labs, mobile and general team meetings. On 25.12.2023, we checked everything and created the final release tag with Elif KÄ±zÄ±lkaya, Hatice Erk and Fatma Sena AlÃ§Ä±. I wrote the annotation part in the Final Report. As frontend and mobile teams, we were always in touch to be aligned and synced.

* **Responsibilities:** 
    * **Milestone 1:**   I reviewed the UML Diagrams completed last semester. I worked on implementing the home page from scratch and creating our folders with my team. After the design is reviewed with the frontend team, I was responsible for implementing forgot password pages according to our design related decisions and connect forgot password pages to the backend API. I was assigned to implement a custom widget to be used while viewing game objects. We also created a .apk file for deliverables. I actively took notes during customer milestone and shared my observations with my teammates.
    *  **Milestone 2:** As part of my role, I am tasked with a diverse set of responsibilities spanning mobile app development and backend connectivity. Key among these is the implementation of mobile follow/unfollow functionality and the establishment of a robust backend connection. Security is a paramount concern, and I actively contribute by adding tokenization to API requests from the mobile app. In the realm of user engagement, I play a central role in crafting a seamless experience, creating a user profile page and enhancing game visibility for unregistered users. Addressing UI/UX concerns, I ensure a visually polished interface, tackling issues like pixel overflow in the pages. As a reviewer, I provide insights for refining game stories, average ratings, and contribute to milestone achievements like creating .apk files. Navigational features, such as drawers for game pages and forum searches, fall within my purview. I also contribute to the meticulous revision of game pages in the mobile environment, ensuring accuracy and visual appeal. My responsibilities reflect a holistic approach to mobile app development, prioritizing functionality, security, and user satisfaction.
    *  **Milestone 3:** I have been mainly assigned to work on all search functionalities in mobile, that is game search, thread search, and user search in detail. I resolved image size problem in mobile. And also I built last activites section for mobile app. I also reviewed PRs of my team and resolved conflicts in some of them.
* **Main contributions:** 
    *  **Milestone 1:** 
          - I share my ideas about technologies that could be used in the implementation for mobile app
          - I added recommendation operation to Sequence Diagram
          - I worked on implementing the home page with my team. We also discussed about color theme and design of the mobile application.
          - We created the folder "mobile" and initialized the application inside it.
          - I created empty placeholder pages for mobile app
          - I implemented forgot password pages for mobile app
          - I changed forgot password page style after the design is finalized by both mobile and frontend teams.
          - We created .apk file for Milestone 1 deliverables
          - During Milestone 1 Presentation, I actively took notes considering audience and customer reactions.
    *  **Milestone 2:**
          * Spearheading the development of mobile follow/unfollow functionality for games, a crucial feature for enhancing user engagement.
          * Establishing a robust backend connection to ensure the responsiveness and efficiency of the mobile application.
          * Actively contributing to fortifying the security posture of the mobile application by implementing tokenization into API requests, elevating data security.
          * Crafting a comprehensive user profile page within the mobile app to provide users with a seamless display of information and an intuitive interface for enhanced interaction and personalization.
          * Implementing updates to expand game visibility to unregistered users, enticing potential users to explore further and register.
          * Enhancing the search functionality within the app to ensure users can effortlessly discover and engage with their preferred games.
          * Addressing nuanced UI/UX concerns, specifically resolving pixel overflow in the pages of mobile app.
          * Contributing insights and enhancements to refine game stories and average ratings on game pages.
          * Reviewer role in the generation of .apk files for project milestones, streamlining the deployment process.

    *  **Milestone 3:**
        - I created a custom bottomNavigationBar widget for flexibility.
        - I designed and implemented search landing page.
        - I designed and implemented detailed game search. Games can be searched by many fields like, title tag, platform etc.

### Muhammet Tayyip KamiloÄŸlu
* **Member**: Muhammet Tayyip KamiloÄŸlu, Group 7, Frontend
* **Responsibilities:** 
    * **Milestone 1:** I have had important roles to update our documentation to compatible with new semester and new team members. I also took part on reviewing and updating last semester's requirements. I added mockups with respect to our new requirements such as entity page and richer Game page. I als took place on design related meetings such as determining color palette, logo, and general page design. As frontend developer I implemented login, signup and logout functionality for web application. Fixed some bugs and reviewed the codes that written by my teammates.
    * **Milestone 2:**  I took on several important tasks to enhance our system's functionality and user experience. Notably, I designed and implemented a change password page, reinforcing our platform's security measures. To arrane collaboration and documentation, I  updated and finalized our lab 5 report, ensuring its integrity, and submitted it to our GitHub repository through a well-crafted pull request. Addressing user interaction, I successfully incorporated a show password feature across login, signup, forgot password, and change password pages, enhancing accessibility. Furthermore, I played a key role in expanding our forum capabilities by designing and implementing the create thread page, to promoote engaging discussions within our community. Additionally, I initiated the development of a create entity page.
    * **Final Milestone:** In recent developments, I successfully implemented a 'create entity' page to facilitate user-generated discussions through threads. Additionally, I introduced a detailed search feature on both the games and forums pages. To enhance user engagement, I integrated a suggested games section in both the general games page and the related games section on specific game pages. A significant enhancement was the implementation of an annotation feature in the description section of the entity page and the trivia section of game pages, following thorough research about it. Further, I implemented general search functionalities in the header component, games page, and forums page, with an attempt to incorporate semantic search in the headerâ€”although it currently operates slow and needs refinement. The creation of a group page was another notable addition. Moreover, I introduced an 'upcoming titles' component on the games page to keep users informed about upcoming games and DLCs. Finally, the development of a versatile 'GameCard' component was implemented for utilization in both the games page and the related games tab of the game page, enhancing the presentation of essential game information.
* **Main Contributions:** 
    * **Milestone 1:**
        * I have reviewed a part of the requirements and updated them with Yunus Emre AltuÄŸ.
        * I updated our general README.md file according to our new team members and new semester and course.
        * Helped to decide on the game palette and project logo with Yunus Emre AltuÄŸ, Elif KÄ±zÄ±lkaya, and Hatice Erk.
        * With Hatice Erk, I created a logo and found a font to our brand name.
        * I worked with Elif KÄ±zÄ±lkaya and Yunus Emre AltuÄŸ to design the homepage and general page structure.
        * I created a GitHub actions pipeline to auto mate frontend deployment to AWS instance with Yunus Emre AltuÄŸ and Elif KÄ±zÄ±lkaya.
        * I have revised mockups and added new mockups for our new pages with Hatice Erk.
        * I have designed and implemented Login page for frontend.
        * I have designed and implemented Signup page for frontend.
        * I have implemented Logout feature for frontend.
        * With my teammates Hatice Erk, Kardelen Erdal, and Elif KÄ±zÄ±lkaya, I prepared user scenarios and presentation slides for our software demo.
        * I took active role on firs customer meeting presentation alongside with Elif KÄ±zÄ±lkaya, Yunus Emre AltuÄŸ, and Kardelen Erdal.
    * **Milestone 2:** 
        * I designed and implemented change password page.
        * I updated and finalized our lab 5 report and submitted it to Github by opening a pull request.
        * I designed and implemented the create thread page for to create forum threads.
        * Added show password feature to the login, signup, forgot password and change password pages.
        * I designed and implemented create entity page, but didn't connect it with backend.
    * **Final Milestone:** 
        * I implemented create entity page to give users chance to create thread and discuss about it.
        * I implemented detailed search in both games page and forums page. Users can filter and sort what they wonder.
        * I added suggested games section to the games page and game page's related games section. Users now can get suggestions based on their followed games.
        * I made research about how we can implement annotation on our project. After researches I also implemented annotation feature in entity page's description section and game page's trivia seciton.
        * I tested mobile application for peer testing and gave feedbackst to improve our mobile application.
        * I implemented general searches in header component, games page and forums page. I also implemented the semantic search feature in header search. However it works very slow and it is not easy to use.
        * I implemented the group page where users can see group members, group threads, group game, and group image. I also add edit group page from this page.
        * I added upcoming titles component to games page. By doing this now users can get news about upcoming games and DLCs easily.
        * I created a component to represent a game. Its name is GameCard and we use this in games page and related games tab of the game page. In this component we show to users game cover, name, developer, bio, average rating and tags.

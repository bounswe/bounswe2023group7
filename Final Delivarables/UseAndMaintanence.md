##  How to run frontend?

*  **Prerequisites**

    Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

### Steps to Deploy

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group7.git
     ```
2. **Go to Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd ludos/frontend
   ```
3. **Ensure that you have docker installed and running.**
4. **Build the Docker Image and Run:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```
    
5. **Access Our Project**
 Now, it is available at *localhost:3000/*


### Deployed Version of frontend
Go to our website link which we also shared via Discord channel of the course and submitted through moodle.

## How to run mobile app?
- You can download APK version of the app from the link provided in the submitted version of this file and directly run it in your Android device.
- If you want to use an emulator to open the application:
  - You can download an Android emulator with Android Studio through [this link](https://developer.android.com/studio?hl=tr).
  - Then you can easily run the application on Android Studio following [this guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-import-existing-flutter-project-in-android-studio/).
## How to use emulator for mobile app?
- Install Android Studio. 
-Go to 'Tools' section and select 'Device Manager'. 
-Click the 'Create Device'.
-Select a device from phone category. Customize size and system image. (I choose Android API and Pixel 5 because most of the Android phones size 6.1'.)
-Go to Device Manager and select created device, click "Launch this AVD in the emulator."
-After the emulation starts, and visible in running devices; run the 'main.dart'.
-It creates an APK and loads it to emulator, you can use it like an Android device. 

## How to run backend application?
Deployed Swagger Documentation: provided in the submitted version of this file

```WORKDIR=./ludos/backend```<br/>
1. Create a .env file for the environment variables. It is included in the zip file submitted to moodle. <br/>
2. Run ```docker compose up --build``` <br/>
3. Now, the api is available with localhost:8080 base url.

## [Software Release](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group7/releases/tag/final-submission-g7)
## Unit Test Reports
- We have written unit tests for our backend application. We have used the jest framework for unit testing. We have mocked our repository layer functions so that we do not need a database connection while running the tests. We have created a GitHub Actions workflow that runs unit tests when a pull request that includes changes in the backend folder is created. This workflow also runs npm run build and npm run lint commands to check build errors and format errors.
- We have created unit tests for some of the controller functions. The tests may be run with the `npm test` command. The results of the tests can be found in the picture below.

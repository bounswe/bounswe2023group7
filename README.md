<details open><summary><h2> 1. Description </h2></summary>

This project is basically a gaming community platform where different users, including developers, gamers, and e-sports players, can socialize and collaborate. We aim to create an environment in which users can discuss with each other, read reviews, organise events such as e-sports tournament, join the game communities and benefit from many more opportunities like these. Except video games, the platform can be extended for board games too. As an example, the platform can have functionalities similar to group finders in MMORPGs to match people.
